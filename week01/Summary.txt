Data Science has been emerged from long history it has started from "reformation of academic statistics" and then lead to Data Analysis later Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. They were many exhortations raised regarding the label "Data Analysis", Then after the introduction of the statistical packages and comparisons of frequencies of the bigrams of statistical and data analysis and research of the workflows everyone could agree with Cleveland by 2001 that there could be such a field as “data science.”
Data Science without statistics is possible, even desirable, statistics is the least important part of data science. Breiman was right to exhort Statisticians to better understand the Predictive modeling culture, but his paper didn’t clearly reveal the culture’s ‘secret sauce’. After several exhortations by the exhortees , Common Task Framework was a crucial and unappreciated model proposed by Mark Liberman states which states that a publicly available training dataset involving, for each observation, a list of many feature measurements, and a class label for that observation.
Data Science means the coupling of scientific discovery and the ability to take data to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualise it, to communicate it and practice involves the collection, management, processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of vast amounts of heterogeneous data associated with a diverse array of scientific, translational, and inter-disciplinary applications.
